# 5. 'os' Module

The [`os` module](https://docs.kscript.org/#os), available in the kscript standard library, is one of the most important modules to know. Using the functions and types defined within `os` allows you to interface with the computer. For example, the file system, environment variables, threading, process spawning, and so on.


This is just a brief introduction to the `os` module. For more complete and in depth documentation, see the [official documentation for the `os` module](https://docs.kscript.org/#os).
