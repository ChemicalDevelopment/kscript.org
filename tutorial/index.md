Welcome to the official kscript tutorial! This a multi-part series that covers the basics of kscript, from running your first line of kscript, to more syntax elements, and even extending kscript with your own types and functions.

This tutorial is meant for programmers and non-programmers alike. Therefore, it may explain things that most programmers will already be familiar with. It is hoped that anyone can read this tutorial and start programming kscript afterwards.
