These modules are in the standard library, which means on any version or installation of kscript (barring a few exceptions), you can import any of these modules, and use the functionality described here.

To import a module (say, `os`), you can use:

```ks
>>> import os
```

In general, the `import <module>` statement can be used to import a module with a given name.
